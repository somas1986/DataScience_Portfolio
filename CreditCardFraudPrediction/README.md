# Credit Card Fraud Prediction

A project that focuses on Credit Card Fraud using various models

## Description

   Customers expect to have a secure banking experience, and providing a solid fraud-detecting system has become an integral part of the credit card industry. I would like to build an automated system that detects fraudulent patterns and flags and temporarily blocks such transactions for customers to review, approve, or deny. 

   The main aim of this project is to build a prediction system using different models to track various patterns, abort abnormal transactions, and notify customers about suspected fraudulent activity on their credit cards.
